Simple example based on the Waterfront.Server publicly released docker image
You have to provide your own certificates (probably self-signed) for paths in wf_config and docker-compose:
  private key at /etc/waterfront/certs/localhost.key
  certificate at /etc/waterfront/certs/localhost.crt and /etc/docker/registry/certs/localhost.crt
Authentication server will be served at localhost:5001
Docker registry will be served at localhost:5000
